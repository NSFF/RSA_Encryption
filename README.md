# RSA_Encryption
This is a MATLAB project I made in 2014 for a course in the Bachelor Physics at the Free university of Brussels (VUB). It Encrypts and decrypts a String. All the math behind it, was made by myself. (so no higher level methods were used)

The challenge of this project was using very big numbers. I had to use very creative ways to store very big prime numbers.
